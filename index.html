        		<h1>Welcome to the blog on low-power design!</h1>
            <h1>Short Bio</h1>
            <p>I am a researcher with main focus on low power design techniques. I am intersetd in low power architectures, cache architecture, pipeline and design aspects of low power devices for IoT applications and embedded systems. To read more about my research please click <a href="http://cdnc.itec.kit.edu/21_418.php">here</a>.

			<h2> Demands for low power operation </h2>
				<p>The increasing demand for battery operated devices in the scope of mobile computing and Internet of Things (<b>IoT</b>) applications has created a shift in the design paradigm of modern electronic devices. There are various academic and industrial efforts to enable ultra-low power operation for IoT device. The underlying questions to be addressed includes:  
					<ul>
						<li> How feasible these efforts are </li>
						<li> What are the price to pay and their gains as well. </li>
						<li> More importantly how are these solutions accepted in the industries and high-tech fabrications. </li>
					</ul>
